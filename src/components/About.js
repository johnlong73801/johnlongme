                My name is John. I am a web developer with a passion for building
                complex web applications. I am currently attending Bloc.io following
                the web developer track. At Bloc I have learned JavaScript, Git, HTML,
                CSS, Command Line, NodeJS, ReactJS and using a Back end as a Service.
                I anticipate my completion of my program by the start of the summer 2018.
                I was a Police Officer for the City of Woodward for over two years. While
                working as a patrol officer I developed a program for tracking activity
                using C#. My interest in programming came at the age of 15 when I first
                installed Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2005 and read a book on Visual
                Basic. Since then I have continued to learn new languages. While I was
                working as a Frac Hand I wrote two programs using Android Studio in Java.
                These programs where then published to the Play Store and totals over 1200
                installs between the two with around 300 active users. Recently the
                opportunity presented itself for me to change careers and follows my dreams
                of working as a full time developer. I enrolled in Bloc.io in February of 2018.
                The program is estimated to take 8 months to complete and is self paced. In just
                one month I completed nearly half the program. I am passionate about learning and
                love to learn new things and embrace change.
